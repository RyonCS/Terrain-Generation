**Personal Information and Resources**
 
* Name: Ryon Sajnovsky
* How many hours did it take you to complete this final project? Over 40+
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors? Professor Shah for project ideas.
* Did you use any external resources? 
  * Note it is fair to utilize some tutorials--cite them here. You **must** add your own personal touch however!
  * Professor Shah's supplied code in Shader.cpp/.hpp, Camera.cpp/.hpp (with some modifications), Image.cpp/.hpp, Texture.cpp/.hpp (with modifications).

  * (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the Final Assignment? How could the instructor improve the final project?
  The best part of this project for me was adding in as many things I learned as I could to this project. I generated a plane, used a height map, added a light, sampled from various textures, interpolated the camera, and generated a skybox. It was really amazing to see how all of these topics tied together to create a really interesting visual project. I don't think anything about the final project could be improved. I felt like I knew what I needed to do and had the resources I needed to complete this project. On a personal note, I wish I had started sooner as there were many more things I wanted to do with this project such as:
  * Scale the terrain to be much larger.
  * Utilize a sky-sphere that moved around the terrain.
  * Add a light source where the sun in the skysphere was to generate sunlight.
  * Water movement and reflections.
